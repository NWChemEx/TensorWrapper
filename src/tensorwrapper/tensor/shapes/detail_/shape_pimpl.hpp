 *
 *  The base PIMPL is suitable for tensors which are either dense or whose
 *  sparsity is determined upon filling in the tensor (assuming the tensor
 *  backend supports such a use case).
 *
 *  All PIMPLs in the Shape hierarchy are expected to inherit from this class.
 *  This instance defines the API that the Shape class will use to interact with
 *  the PIMPL. Derived instances of Shape will typically have a derived PIMPL
 *  instance associated with them. The derived PIMPL instances may define
 *  additional functions/state and the derived Shape instance may downcast to
 *  interact with that additional functions/state.
 *
 *  Derived classes should override the following functions as appropriate:
 *
 *  - clone_
 *  - hash_
 *
 *  @tparam FieldType The type of the elements in the tensor. Assumed to be
 *                    either field::Scalar or field::Tensor.
