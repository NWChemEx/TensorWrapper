/** @brief Base class for operations in the operation layer.
 *
 *  This class basically exists so that we don't have to do a bunch of SFINAE to
 *  only enable fully templated versions of `operator+`, `operator-`, etc. for
 *  the operations in this component of tensorwrapper, i.e., without this class
 *  we have:
 *
 *  @code
 *  template<typename LHS, typename RHS>
 *  auto operator+(LHS&& lhs, RHS&& rhs) {}
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  which requires SFINAE so that it's only enabled for choices of LHS and RHS
 *  like `MultOp<L, R>`. With this class we can do:
 *
 *  @code
 *  template<typename LHS, typename RHS>
 *  auto operator+(const OpLayer<LHS>& lhs, const OpLayer<RHS>& rhs){}
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  @tparam DerivedType The type of the class we're adding to the operations
 *                      layer. @p DerivedType is assumed to derive from
 *                      `OpLayer<DerivedType>`.
