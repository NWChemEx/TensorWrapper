/** @brief Increments the provided index subject to the provided ranges
 *
 *  This function will take an associative index (map from string indices to
 *  integral values) and update it using the provided associative ranges (map
 *  from a string index to a pair of integral values such that the first value
 *  of the pair is the beginning of the range and the second value of the pair
 *  is the just past the end of the range). Indices are updated in column-major
 *  order (the first index runs fast).
 *
 *  @param[in,out] idx The index to increment. It will be incremented in place
 *                     (i.e., the value will be mutated). It will be reset to
 *                     the first value if iteration has completed.
 *  @param[in] ranges  The range each index spans. Each range is assumed to be
 *                     half-open such that the beginning value is in the range,
 *                     but the ending value is just outside the range.
 *  @return `true` if iteration has completed and `false` otherwise.
