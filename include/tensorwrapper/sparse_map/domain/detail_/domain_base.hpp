 *  to Domain<ElementIndex> and Domain<TileIndex> and put them into the
 *  DomainBase class. DomainBase instances are not meant to be directly
 *  instantiated, rather users should always declare either a
 *  Domain<ElementIndex> or a Domain<TileIndex> instance.
 *
 *  @tparam DerivedType The type of the Domain using this class as a base class.
 *                      Parts of DomainBase work by CRTP hence the need to know
 *                      what class is being implemented.
 *  @tparam IndexType  The type of the index in the Domain. Should be the same
 *                     as `typename DerivedType::value_type`.
 *
 *  @note This class only implements operations among Domains which store the
 *        same index types. Operations among Domains with different index types
 *        must be implemented in the derived classes.
