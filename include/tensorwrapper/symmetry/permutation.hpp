 *  This class models a permutation made up of zero or more cycles. Non-trivial
 *  cycles (those which actually swap modes of the tensor) are stored
 *  explicitly all other cycles are stored implicitly.
 *
 *  @note Stored cycles will be canonicalized and sorted. "Canonicalized" means
 *        that each cycle will be cyclically permuted until the smallest
 *        element is first), e.g., the cycle 231 will be stored as 123. Sorting
 *        will be done lexicographically, e.g., the cycle 012 will come before
 *        the cycle 345.
