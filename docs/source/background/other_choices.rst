Existing Tensor Libraries
#########################

What follows are the existing tensor libraries we are aware of. There are a ton
of tensor libraries and we have limited ourselves to C++ libraries providing
tensor functionality. The libraries are listed in alphabetical order.

******************************
Cyclops Tensor Framework (CTF)
******************************

- `GitHub <https://github.com/cyclops-community/ctf>`__

******
Fastor
******

- `GitHub <https://github.com/romeric/Fastor>`__

Fastor :cite:`Poya2017` is focused on tensors with known shapes.

- Total tensor size must be known in advance (not just number of modes, but
  also the extents of those modes).

*******
FTensor
*******

- `GitLab <https://gitlab.com/wlandry/ftensor>`__

****************************
Intelligent Tensor (ITensor)
****************************

- `GitHub <https://github.com/ITensor/ITensor>`__

*********
libtensor
*********

- `GitHub <https://github.com/epifanovsky/libtensor>`__

*******
PyTorch
*******

- `GitHub <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch>`__
- `Docs <https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/>`__

I know what you're saying, "Wait PyTorch is in Python" well they have a C++ API
so it's on the list.
